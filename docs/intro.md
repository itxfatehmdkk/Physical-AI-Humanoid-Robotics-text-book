# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Action"**, an open-source textbook exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the development of artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital environments, Physical AI systems must navigate, understand, and manipulate the real world through sensors and actuators.

## The Challenge of Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence represents a fundamental shift in how we think about AI. Rather than intelligence being an abstract, software-based phenomenon, embodied intelligence suggests that true AI emerges through the interaction between an agent's "mind," its physical body, and its environment.

This textbook explores these concepts in depth, examining:
- How physical form influences cognitive processes
- The role of sensorimotor interaction in intelligence
- Approaches to creating humanoid robots with human-like capabilities
- The challenges and opportunities in bridging digital and physical intelligence

## Using This Textbook

This interactive textbook features an integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that can answer questions about the content. Simply select text on any page and ask the chatbot about it, or pose general questions about Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
