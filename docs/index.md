# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Action

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This resource provides a university-level exploration of the transition from traditional digital AI to embodied intelligence systems, with a focus on humanoid robots and their applications.

## About This Book

This textbook is designed to guide you through the fundamental concepts, technologies, and practical implementations needed to understand and develop autonomous humanoid systems. We follow a progressive approach that builds from basic robotics principles to advanced AI integration.

## Chapter Overview

### [Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI](/docs/chapter1-introduction-to-physical-ai)
Foundations of Physical AI, the transition from Digital AI to Embodied Intelligence, the importance of humanoid robots, and why embodiment matters.

### [Chapter 2: Robotics Fundamentals](/docs/chapter2-robotics-fundamentals)
Sensors (LiDAR, IMUs, Cameras), actuators and motor control, kinematics basics, and an overview of the robotics landscape.

### [Chapter 3: ROS 2: The Robotic Nervous System](/docs/chapter3-ros2-architecture)
ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, actions, writing ROS 2 packages in Python, launch files & parameter configs, and URDF overview for humanoids.

### [Chapter 4: Simulation with Gazebo and Unity](/docs/chapter4-simulation)
Gazebo physics environment, SDF/URDF robot modeling, simulated sensors, Unity for high-fidelity visualization, and creating a digital twin workflow.

### [Chapter 5: NVIDIA Isaac Platform](/docs/chapter5-nvidia-isaac)
Isaac Sim, Isaac SDK & accelerated ROS, VSLAM and navigation, RL-based training, and sim-to-real techniques.

### [Chapter 6: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/chapter6-vla)
LLM-based planning, OpenAI Whisper speech-to-action, converting natural language → ROS 2 action pipeline, and bipedal locomotion & manipulation planning.

### [Chapter 7: Capstone: Build an Autonomous Humanoid](/docs/chapter7-capstone)
Voice → plan → movement → object identification → manipulation, full pipeline with ROS 2 + Isaac + LLM, and deployment blueprint.

## Learning Path

We recommend following the chapters in order as each builds upon the concepts introduced in previous chapters. However, readers with specific interests may jump to relevant chapters:
